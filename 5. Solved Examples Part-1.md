## 🏦 Example 1: Banking System – Calculating Interest
  - Scenario: A bank wants to calculate the interest on a savings account balance.
### Problem Statement:
  - A customer deposits $5000 in a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%.
  - Calculate the interest earned after 3 years using the simple interest formula:
  - Simple Interest=(Principal x Rate x Time)/100
#### Python Solution:
          
```python
principal = 5000  # Initial deposit
rate = 5  # Annual interest rate in percent
time = 3  # Duration in years

# Simple Interest formula
interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Output the result
print(f"Interest earned after {time} years: ${interest}")
```
#### Output:
```
Interest earned after 3 years: $750.0
```

## 🛒 Example 2: Shopping Cart – Calculating Total Price
  - Scenario: An online store needs to calculate the total price of a customer's cart after applying a discount.
### Problem Statement:
  - A customer buys three items with prices $20, $35, and $50. A 10% discount applies if the total purchase exceeds $50. Calculate the final price.
#### Python Solution:
          
```python
# List of item prices
cart = [20, 35, 50] 

# Calculate total price
total_price = sum(cart)

# Apply discount if eligible
if total_price > 50:
    discount = total_price * 0.10  # 10% discount
    final_price = total_price - discount
else:
    final_price = total_price

# Output the result
print(f"Total before discount: ${total_price}")
print(f"Final amount after discount: ${final_price}")

```
#### Output:
```
Total before discount: $105
Final amount after discount: $94.5

```


## 📊 Example 3: Student Grades – Calculating Average and Determining Grade
  - Scenario: A school needs to calculate the average marks of a student and assign a grade.
### Problem Statement:
  - A student scores 85, 90, and 78 in three subjects. The grading criteria are:
        - A: 80 and above
        - B: 70–79
        - C: 60–69
        - F: Below 60
  - Find the student’s final grade.
#### Python Solution:
          
```python
# Student marks
marks = [85, 90, 78]

# Calculate average
average = sum(marks) / len(marks)

# Determine grade
if average >= 80:
    grade = "A"
elif average >= 70:
    grade = "B"
elif average >= 60:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "F"

# Output the result
print(f"Student's Average Marks: {average:.2f}")
print(f"Final Grade: {grade}")


```
#### Output:
```
Student's Average Marks: 84.33
Final Grade: A

```


## 🚕 Example 4: Ride Fare Calculation – Taxi App
  - Scenario: A taxi service charges a base fare of $5 plus $2 per kilometer. Write a program to calculate the fare for a trip of 15 kilometers.

#### Python Solution:
          
```python
# Given data
base_fare = 5  # Base fare in dollars
cost_per_km = 2  # Cost per kilometer in dollars
distance = 15  # Distance traveled in kilometers

# Calculate total fare
total_fare = base_fare + (cost_per_km * distance)

# Output the result
print(f"Total taxi fare for {distance} km: ${total_fare}")

```
#### Output:
```
Total taxi fare for 15 km: $35

```


## 📅 Example 5: Age Calculator – Find Your Age
  - Scenario: A user enters their birth year, and the program calculates their age.

#### Python Solution:
          
```python
# Get current year
from datetime import datetime
current_year = datetime.now().year

# Get user input
birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))

# Calculate age
age = current_year - birth_year

# Output result
print(f"You are {age} years old.")

```
#### Output (if input = 2000):
```
You are 25 years old.
```


## 🏥 Example 6: BMI Calculator – Health & Fitness
  - Scenario: A health app calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user weight and height.
  - Formula: BMI = weight(kg)/height(m^2)
  - BMI Categories:
      - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
      - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
      - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
      - Obese: BMI ≥ 30

#### Python Solution:
          
```python
# Get user input
weight = float(input("Enter your weight (kg): "))
height = float(input("Enter your height (m): "))

# Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Determine category
if bmi < 18.5:
    category = "Underweight"
elif bmi < 24.9:
    category = "Normal weight"
elif bmi < 29.9:
    category = "Overweight"
else:
    category = "Obese"

# Output result
print(f"Your BMI is {bmi:.2f}, which is classified as {category}.")


```
#### Output (if user inputs 70 kg and 1.75 m):
```
Your BMI is 22.86, which is classified as Normal weight.

```


## ⛽ Example 7: Fuel Efficiency – Miles per Gallon (MPG) Calculator
  - Scenario: A car owner wants to calculate fuel efficiency based on miles driven and fuel used.
  - Formula: MPG = Miles Driven / Gallons used

#### Python Solution:
          
```python
# Get user input
miles_driven = float(input("Enter miles driven: "))
gallons_used = float(input("Enter gallons of fuel used: "))

# Calculate MPG
mpg = miles_driven / gallons_used

# Output result
print(f"Your car's fuel efficiency is {mpg:.2f} miles per gallon.")

```
#### Output (if user inputs 300 miles and 10 gallons):
```
Your car's fuel efficiency is 30.00 miles per gallon.

```


## 🎟 Example 8: Movie Ticket Price Calculator – Dynamic Pricing
  - Scenario: A cinema charges ticket prices based on age:
  - Children (under 12): $8
  - Adults (12-60): $12
  - Seniors (60 and above): $10
#### Python Solution:
          
```python
# Get user age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Determine ticket price
if age < 12:
    price = 8
elif age < 60:
    price = 12
else:
    price = 10

# Output result
print(f"Your movie ticket price is: ${price}")

```
#### Output:
```
Your movie ticket price is: $10

```
