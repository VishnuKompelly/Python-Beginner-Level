## Conditional Statements and Loops in Python 🚀

In Python, conditional statements and loops allow you to control the flow of your program. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and logical programs.

---

### 🎯 Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)
Conditional statements help execute a block of code based on a condition.

#### 🔹 Syntax of if Statement
```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
```

#### 🔹 Syntax of if-else Statement
```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
```

#### 🔹 Syntax of if-elif-else Statement
```python
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```
---
### ✅ Examples of Conditional Statements

#### 1️⃣ Checking Voting Eligibility

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```
🔹 Explanation: If the age is 18 or more, the program prints eligibility; otherwise, it prints ineligibility.


#### 2️⃣ Checking Even or Odd Number

```python
number = 7

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an Even number")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an Odd number")
```
🔹 Explanation: The modulus operator % is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.


#### 3️⃣ Grading System Based on Marks
```python
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A+")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F (Fail)")
```

🔹 Explanation: Based on the marks, the appropriate grade is assigned.

## 🔄 Loops in Python
- A loop is a code block that runs a set of statements while a given condition is true. A loop is often used for
performing a repeating task. 
- Ex: The software on a phone repeatedly checks to see if the phone is idle. Once
the time set by a user is reached, the phone is locked. Loops can also be used for iterating over lists like
student names in a roster, and printing the names one at a time

Types of Loops in Python
#### 1. while : 
  - A while loop is a code construct that runs a set of statements, known as the loop body, while a given condition, known as the loop expression, is true.At each iteration, once the loop statement is executed, the loop expression is evaluated again.
  - If true, the loop body will execute at least one more time (also called looping or iterating one more time).
  - If false, the loop's execution will terminate and the next statement after the loop body will execute.
  - Basic Syntax:
    ```python
    while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is True
    ```
  - Example:
    ```python
    num = 1

    while num <= 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1  # Increment by 1
    ```
    - Explanation: The loop starts with num = 1 and runs while num is ≤ 5.



    
#### 2. For Loop :
  - In Python, a container can be a range of numbers, a string of characters, or a list of values. To access objects within a container, an iterative loop can be designed to retrieve objects one at a time. A for loop iterates overall elements in a container. Ex: Iterating over a class roster and printing students' names
  - Range() function in for loop : The range() function is a common approach for implementing counting in a for loop. A range() function generates a sequence of integers between the two numbers given a step size.
  - Basic Syntax :
    ```python
    for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute in each iteration
    ```
  - Example:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
    ```
  - Explanation: The range(1,6) generates numbers from 1 to 5 (6 is excluded).



#### 3. Nested Loops:
  - A nested loop has one or more loops within the body of another loop. The two loops are referred to as outer loop and inner loop. The outer loop controls the number of the inner loop's full execution. More than one inner loop can exist in a nested loop.

#### 4. Break and Continue:
  - Break : A break statement is used within a for or a while loop to allow the program execution to exit the loop once a given condition is triggered. A break statement can be used to improve runtime efficiency when further loop execution is not required.
  - Continue : A continue statement allows for skipping the execution of the remainder of the loop without exiting the loop entirely. A continue statement can be used in a for or a while loop. After the continue statement's execution, the loop expression will be evaluated again and the loop will continue from the loop's expression. A continue statement facilitates the loop's control and readability
  - ✅ Example: Using ```break``` :
    ```
    for num in range(1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        print("Stopping loop at", num)
        break  # Exits the loop
    print(num)
    ```
  - Explanation: The loop stops execution when num == 5.



  - ✅ Example: Using ```continue``` :
    ```
    for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        continue  # Skips iteration when num is 3
    print(num)
    ```
  - Explanation: The number 3 is skipped in the output.


## 💡 Real-World Scenarios of Loops

### ✅ 1. ATM PIN Verification (while loop)
```python
correct_pin = "1234"
attempts = 3

while attempts > 0:
    entered_pin = input("Enter your PIN: ")
    
    if entered_pin == correct_pin:
        print("Access Granted!")
        break
    else:
        attempts -= 1
        print(f"Wrong PIN! {attempts} attempts left.")

if attempts == 0:
    print("Account Locked!")
```
#### 🔹 Explanation: The user gets 3 attempts to enter the correct PIN before getting locked.
---

### ✅ 2. Printing a Multiplication Table (for loop)
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num * i}")
```
#### 🔹 Explanation: This program generates the multiplication table of any number.
---
### ✅ 3. Simulating a Digital Dice (while loop)
```python
import random

while True:
    roll = input("Press Enter to roll the dice or type 'exit' to stop: ")
    
    if roll.lower() == "exit":
        print("Game Over!")
        break
    
    print(f"You rolled a {random.randint(1, 6)}")
```
#### 🔹 Explanation: The loop keeps rolling a dice until the user types "exit".
