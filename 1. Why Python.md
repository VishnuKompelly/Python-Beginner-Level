- Python allows developers to write programs quickly and efficiently, often requiring fewer lines of code than other programming languages.

Let‚Äôs compare how to print the message "Hello, World!" in Python versus Java to illustrate Python's simplicity:
### Java Code
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
### Python Code
```Python
print("Hello, World!")

```
