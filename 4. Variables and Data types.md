# 🎯 Variables and Data Types  

## 🔹 What are Variables?  
Variables are like containers for storing information in a program. Instead of repeatedly using hardcoded values, you can assign values to variables and use them throughout your code.  

### ✨ Why Use Variables?  
Imagine you're building a program to calculate monthly savings. Instead of manually changing the numbers every time, you can use variables like `income` and `expenses`. This makes your code reusable and easier to read.  

### 📌 How to Assign Variables?  
Use the assignment operator (`=`) to assign a value to a variable.  

### 💻 Example:  
```python
age = 25  # Assigning the value 25 to the variable 'age'
name = "Alice"  # Assigning the string 'Alice' to the variable 'name'
is_student = True  # Assigning a boolean value to indicate student status
print(f"{name} is {age} years old and student status is {is_student}")
```

## 📜 Rules for Naming Variables
### ✅ Allowed
  - Names must start with a letter or underscore (```_```).
  - Only letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed (e.g., ```birth_date``` is valid).
  - Case-sensitive (```Age``` and ```age``` are different).
### ❌ Not Allowed:
  - Names cannot start with numbers (```1age``` is invalid).
  - Avoid using reserved keywords like ```if```, ```else```, or ```while```.
## ⚠️ Reserved words or Key words
- Python has reserved words, known as keywords, which have special functions and cannot be used as names
  for variables (or other objects).
- Here are keywords in python.

| `False`     | `await`       | `else`      | `import`      |
| `None`      | `break`       | `except`    | `in`          |
| `True`      | `class`       | `finally`   | `is`          |
| `and`       | `continue`    | `for`       | `lambda`      |
| `as`        | `def`         | `from`      | `nonlocal`    |
| `assert`    | `del`         | `global`    | `not`         |
| `async`     | `elif`        | `if`        | `or`          |
| `pass`      | `raise`       | `return`    | `try`         |
| `while`     | `with`        | `yield`     |

### Before looking into some real world examples lets know about the ```Data Types``` in ```Python```
---
# 🔍 Understanding Data Types in Python
## ❓ What is a Data Type?  
A data type defines the kind of value a variable holds and what operations can be performed on it.  

## 📌 Why Are Data Types Important?  
- Determines how values behave in a program.  
- Example: Mathematical operations can be performed on integers and floats but not strings.  

---

## 💡 Commonly Used Data Types  

### 1️⃣ String  
- Sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double).  
- Can include letters, digits, special characters, and spaces.  
#### Examples:  
```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
email = "user@example.com"
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, World!
```
### 2️⃣ Numerical Data Type
  - ### Integer
  - Python supports two basic number formats, integer and floating-point.
  - An integer represents a whole number, and a floating-point format represents a decimal number.
#### Examples:  
```python
age = 25
temperature = -5
print(f"My age is {age} and today's temperature is {temperature}°C")
```
  - ### Float
  - Represents numbers with a decimal point.
  - Useful for more precise calculations.
#### Examples:  
```python
pi = 3.14159
height = 5.9
print(f"The value of pi is approximately {pi} and my height is {height} feet.")
```
### 3️⃣ Boolean
  - Represents True or False.
  - Typically used in conditional statements and logical operations.
#### Examples:  
```python
is_student = True
has_license = False
print(f"Student Status: {is_student}, License Status: {has_license}")
```
### 4️⃣ Complex Numbers (```complex```)
  - Numbers in the form ```a + bj```, where ```a``` is the real part and ```b``` is the imaginary part.
#### Examples:  
```python
z1 = 3 + 4j  
z2 = 2 - 3j  
sum_complex = z1 + z2  
product_complex = z1 * z2  
print(f"Sum: {sum_complex}, Product: {product_complex}")
```

## 💡 Advanced Data Types
### 🔹 List (```list```):
  - Ordered, mutable collection of items.
  - Can hold elements of different data types.
#### Examples:  
```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.5, True]  

# Accessing and modifying elements
print(fruits[0])        # Access first element
fruits.append("orange")  # Add a new element
print(fruits)
```

### 🔹 Tuple (```tuple```):
  - Ordered, immutable collection of items.
#### Examples:  
```python
# Creating tuples
dimensions = (1920, 1080)  
point = (3, 5, 7)  

# Accessing elements
print(dimensions[0])  # Output: 1920
```

### 🔹 Dictionary (```dict```):
  - Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    #### Examples:  
```python
# Creating a dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}  

# Accessing values
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice

```
### 🔹 Set (```set```):
  - Unordered collection of unique items.
    #### Examples:  
```python
# Creating sets
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}  
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

## 🌟 Real-World Usage Scenarios
| **Data Type**  | **Use Case**                                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **String**     | Storing names, messages, or text content.         |
| **Integer**    | Counting objects, indexing, or doing math.        |
| **Float**      | Representing precise measurements or rates.       |
| **Boolean**    | Logical operations in decision-making.            |
| **Dictionary** | Mapping user data like ID to personal details.    |
| **List**       | Storing an ordered collection of items, mutable.  |
| **Tuple**      | Storing an ordered collection of items, immutable.|
