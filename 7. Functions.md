## Defining a function
 - A function is defined using the def keyword.
 - The first line contains def followed by the function name (insnake case), parentheses, and a colon.
 - The indented body begins with a documentation string describing the function's task and contains the function statements.
 - A function must be defined before the function is called.

## 🔹 Why Use Functions?
Functions make programs:
- ✅ Modular → Code is divided into smaller, manageable parts.
- ✅ Reusable → Write once, use multiple times.
- ✅ Readable → Code is more organized and easier to understand.
- ✅ Efficient → Avoids duplication, making the program shorter and cleaner.

## 🔹 Real-World Example: Online Food Ordering System 🍔📦

Imagine you are developing an online food ordering system for a restaurant like Swiggy or Zomato.

- Steps Without Functions (Inefficient Approach)
    - 1️⃣ Display menu items with prices.
    - 2️⃣ Ask customers what they want to order.
    - 3️⃣ Calculate the total bill.
    - 4️⃣ Generate a bill receipt.
- If the restaurant has multiple branches, you would have to repeat the same steps in different locations, making your code long and inefficient.


## 🔹 Using Functions (Efficient Approach)
Instead of writing the same logic multiple times, we can divide the system into separate functions:

  - 1️⃣ Display the Menu → A function to show all available food items.
  - 2️⃣ Take Customer Order → A function to accept customer choices.
  - 3️⃣ Calculate the Bill → A function to compute the total price.
  - 4️⃣ Generate Receipt → A function to print the final bill.

- Now, whenever another branch of the restaurant needs the same system, you just call these functions! 🚀

## Arguments and parameters
  - A function ```argument``` is a value passed as input during a function call.
  - A function ```parameter``` is a variable representing the input in the function definition.
## Returning from a function
  - A return statement finishes the function execution and can specify a value to return to the function's caller.
### Example
```python
def calc_mpg(miles, gallons):
if gallons > 0:
mpg = miles/gallons
return mpg
else:
print("Gallons can't be 0")
return -1
```

## 🔹 Types of Functions in Python
- 1️⃣ Built-in Functions
  - These are pre-defined functions in Python, such as:

      1. print() → Displays output.
      2. len() → Returns the length of a string or list.
      3. sum() → Calculates the sum of numbers.
- 2️⃣ User-Defined Functions
- - These are functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. For example, a function to calculate the price of a customer's order.

## 🔹 Function Components
- A function typically has:
  - ✔️ Function Name → The name given to the function.
  - ✔️ Parameters (Optional) → Inputs the function needs.
  - ✔️ Return Value (Optional) → The result it gives back after processing.

- For example, in a food ordering system:
    - Function Name: calculate_total()
    - Parameter: Items ordered and their prices
    - Return Value: The final bill amount


##🔹 Benefits of Using Functions in Real-World Applications
  - ✔️ Better Code Organization → Breaks a big program into smaller sections.
  - ✔️ Easy Debugging → If there's an issue, you only fix one function instead of searching the whole program.
  - ✔️ Reusability → You can use the same function for different restaurant branches.
  - ✔️ Scalability → If the restaurant adds more items, you just update one function instead of changing multiple places in the code.


## 🔹 Conclusion
  - Functions are essential in Python programming and are widely used in real-world applications like:

      - E-commerce Websites (Amazon, Flipkart) → Handling user authentication, payments, and order processing.
      - Banking Systems → Managing transactions, balance inquiries, and statements.
      - Healthcare Applications → Processing patient data and calculating medical bills.
      - Chatbots & AI Assistants → Handling user queries and providing automated responses.
  - Understanding and using functions effectively can make your code cleaner, faster, and more professional! 🚀
